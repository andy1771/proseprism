<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong> - This is not a hard and fast guide. This is entirely from my experience of college life and clearing GATE exam. Also, this may not fit well for people who wish to score insanely well to get a PSU job, but it can help you start at least, or give you some sense of direction. I hope this serves the purpose I set out to achieve while writing, which is helping you kick start your GATE preparation.</p>

<p>First things first, I am a 5th-year student of Computer Science, Dual Degree course (and a writer) and I recently cleared GATE 2020 with marks 42/100. Yes, pretty okay, not great.&nbsp;<em>Why this post?</em>&nbsp;Because I know exactly what not to do but also, what to do to at the very least clear your GATE exam without compromising the college fun and other responsibilities, inflow of assignments, and academic stress you might have. <strong>You'll get thousands of idealistic preparation blogs out there on the internet, but very few giving you reality checks and personal failure stories.</strong></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I'll be dividing this post into various sections, to give you a "conversation" experience, so let's kick away. You can jump to any section you like.</p>

<p><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Warning </span>- This is not going to be a perfect "I studied everyday for 2 years for GATE" story.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I had decided to start studying for the GATE exam from my 2nd year with a perfect plan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The whole third semester, I made short notes/ formulae sheet that could be revised before the GATE exams, and whatever subjects were in my curriculum, I planned to study them sincerely as well as solve their GATE questions for the next 2 years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I could, yes, do this for the 3rd semester. But I couldn't continue it for more than one semester. College stress, club duties, projects, finding internships, tests, parties, events, fest everything comes over and wipes away our perfect plans. Especially, if you are in 3rd year, you'll know what I am talking about.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Though I could not continue with my idealistic GATE plan, what I made sure was I was good in my academics in general, and&nbsp;<em>giving my tests and exams sincerely</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nope, I'm not at all a typical first bencher or someone who studies everyday (though I admire them) as I have a lot going on, my hobbies, my club, and so on so forth, EVERYDAY. But I am sincere enough for my exams and dedicatedly study 15 days before midterm and 20-25 days before my end semesters exam to compensate for my inability to focus the entire semester.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That is needed and I think, acceptable + affordable to get a good understanding of the subject and score well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, even if my plan was in the drain,&nbsp;<strong>I made sure whatever academic related reading/understanding</strong>&nbsp;I was doing, I did it well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From August 2019, which was 7 months before my GATE exam I made a plan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I had to clear GATE at any cost because my almost 1L worth scholarship was on stake plus I wanted to test myself if I had at least taken on basic concepts of engineering.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The plan went on smoothly for 2 months but it came down pretty much after it because of midterms, my duties as the convenor of English club, team lead for my major project, and that's how the entire semester flew like a fly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>December 2019 came, and Woah, I was full-time MESSED UP.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I had from my 2nd year always thought that I'd give GATE preparation a good duration of at least a year, and not like my seniors who started only 2 months in advance. But sadly, that had happened. I did sort of practice aptitude in December but not extensively put myself in the preparation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>J<em>anuary 8, 2020</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first day of the session and now it was a <strong>Do or Die</strong>&nbsp;situation for me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I made a very very hard schedule, yet again, doing a subject in 4 days, focusing on subjects who are scoring, practicing aptitude every weekend, revising well, as well as doing one subject test everyday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I studied like a maniac, attended my classes too, and stuck to the plan. Whatever break I had, I studied in it. My goal was to at least cover my to-do list topics (which were never attainable) and if not, do anything to extract 6 hours a day for GATE. This made me motivated enough to study between class breaks, or try to extract even 1 hour in the morning before college started.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I am not super intelligent or very very sharp. I take my time in understanding but I am dedicated enough. On January 10th, my friends and I had given a mock test to check on basic knowledge and I got 14/100 marks. They got 25 - 30ish and one of them even got 50</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I got wrapped in an inferiority complex and anxious about the exam but I knew I had to compensate all of this by hard work</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last week before the GATE exam, I got almost 45ish in the mock tests I attempted and finally a 42 in the main exam.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, I don't wish to inspire you into thinking&nbsp;<em>"Just study for a month and it'll be okay"</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But, I want to tell you that plans can fail, but just be sincere throughout your year, have fun, do extracurricular and be vigilant towards GATE too.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size" id="how-gate"><strong>How is the exam? What does it require from us?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The exam is&nbsp;<strong><em>not insanely hard</em></strong>, like IIT JEE.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's easy at some places because you only require basic knowledge of formulae and definition to solve those questions and mediocre in some other places because concepts and thorough thinking is required. About 10-12 questions are hard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That's why it is<strong>&nbsp;approachable to clear</strong>&nbsp;it given you revise your subjects and make 3-4 subjects (especially the one whose weightage has been high from past 4-5 years) your strong point.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's a good exam and checks your subject knowledge.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>People cannot clear it majorly when they do not revise subjects. I had people tell me that they knew the question was easy but couldn't recall the formulae or the understanding of the word.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next, the exam requires you to<strong>&nbsp;identify your focus subjects</strong>&nbsp;because that'll, for the first step, help you clear it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I couldn't obviously cover all the subjects in 30 days, so I stuck to some favorite yet scoring and important ones and for the rest of them, I revised their formulae and basic definition so I can at least attack insanely easy questions of those subjects (I actually got 5-8 marks out of two subjects I had touched a day before the exam).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next, as far as theoretical questions are concerned, I felt they (in the CSE stream) are generally hard so I preferred picking those subjects which had solvable numericals (DS, TOC, Compiler design, Digital Logic, DBMS for CSE)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I hope this gives a rough, and basic idea of the exam, and that it is <strong><em>approachable, attainable, and can be conquered.</em></strong></p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size" id="you-gate"><strong>What should you, as a 2nd/3rd year student do?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I'm glad you're planning to take on it from now. That's a great start!<br>I'll come to what you can do in being meticulous about the preparation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1. First things first, read about the&nbsp;<strong>exam pattern, the rank vs marks vs score charts</strong> (<a href="https://www.collegedekho.com/articles/gate-rank-vs-marks-vs-score-analysis/">Marks analysis and cutoff</a>) <strong>, and your subject-specific weightage.</strong>&nbsp;Even if you have not studied those subjects as a part of your curriculum now, this exercise will help you in being vigilant about them whenever they are in your course. Read some blogs of your specific stream to know more about which subjects are important and gather some sources.&nbsp;<em>Great planning goes a long way!</em>&nbsp;(Had I not nailed my one month plan, I would not have been writing this :p)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2. <strong>Whatever courses you study in all your semesters from now, study them well.</strong>&nbsp;Idealistically, try studying from a book or a course, but even if you cannot do this, try preparing them well for the end semesters. You will at least know your basic concepts. For second-year students, you'll be starting those core and important subjects now, so be focused. If you're in the third year, you've read some core subjects previously. No issues, if you weren't serious about them, before, but all you can do is try picking 3-4 of your previous important subjects and study / solve them again while being meticulous for the present ones.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>3. <strong>Keep your eye open</strong>&nbsp;for your strong points, try to know yourself more. You have an ample amount of time to attack your weak areas too. Realize what subjects are your<em>&nbsp;favorite</em>, have&nbsp;<em>good weightage</em>, and are&nbsp;<em>solvable numerical based</em>. You can keep a list of them and if they have great intersection points among them, yay.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>4. Try to prepare a notes copy. Apart from the semester copy, make a short notes copy and keep a checklist of&nbsp;<strong>important topics of the subject</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>important formulae/concept for revision</strong>, and topics that you haven't studied for exams but are there in the GATE curriculum. It does not take more than 2-3 hours for this. You can make one during your endsem preparation and it'll be a great help even for your exams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>5. <strong>Solve GATE questions</strong>. Try getting a previous year book with subject- wise question. Sites like geeksforgeeks are helpful too. Try going for a weekly solve basis but in any case&nbsp;<strong>attempt some GATE questions before sitting in any test/exam.</strong>&nbsp;College professors give previous year questions too, and there's no better time to brush em up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>6. You can also do this exercise for all the subjects in your end-sem break. It is not as hard as it sounds, it will help you get an in-depth understanding of the whole semester.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you have done this for even a year (or if you are great, then for two years) then no one can stop you from scoring a 60+ and if you check the marks vs rank stats, you'll find you get a pretty good (almost under 1000 for most streams) rank on this. Mostly it gets a bit tough to cross the 50 mark line because of negative marking. And hence, anything above 50 is GREAT (Not talking about PSUs, please check them yourselves).</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you stick to your initial plans for the entire journey, heartiest congratulations to you. However, this is "I could not do what I planned" friendly blog and I wish to guide you enough that if everything goes to trash, you can at least clear GATE. Also, some Final Year Guidelines.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1. Even if you maintain all the short notes/formulae register there are high chances you won't remember your 3rd-semester subjects in your 7th semester. It is okay and very normal. Even if you feel you remember everything and a Lil revision is okay for you, be sure to check yourself because little knowledge and wrong concepts are a dangerous thing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2. In those last few months, you can do subject-wise YouTube courses tailored for GATE. If you have studied semesters even okay-ish well, those videos will be easy to understand and fast to brush up (THAT IS WHY pt. 2 and 3 of the previous section is VERY IMPORTANT). Being thorough with concepts will help you attack questions even out of the "Previous years question" bracket.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>3. Honestly, half of your plans WILL go to fail. College is about exploring yourself, shit happens, assignment, clubs happen and all of them are important for your being. So, it's okay. You'll be able to do it, worse to worse even if a month is left you'll be able to do it. BUT, you need to have a proper schedule then. Also, even if making the short notes notebook, solving MCQs or any other plan goes to the drain, in your 2nd-3rd year please&nbsp;<strong>remember to at least study for your endsem well</strong>.&nbsp;<em>Half the battle is won then.</em>&nbsp;Also, it will help you attack those 5-6 subjects videos of the above point and finish them fast because you will only be recalling them subjects now.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>4<strong><em>.&nbsp;</em></strong>I could not do everything according to my schedule. But whenever I got time, I prepared. I remember solving GATE questions of some of my favorite subjects even before a normal test. It does not matter if you cannot execute the plan flawlessly. Try whatever you can.&nbsp;<strong><em>Hold on to whatever weapons you can, in all your battle.</em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>5. <strong>HOME STRETCH MATTERS</strong>.&nbsp;<em>The last two months matter</em>. Revise/ Study like hell the last one-two months. Make your strong points stronger and keep solving tests, and previous years' questions. I know someone who did 7 months of formal coaching but left all of it last 2 months. They scored lesser than me. If this doesn't explain the importance of that one month, nothing can.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>6. If you have just studied the subject and cannot crack the question, it is OKAY. I couldn't do 70% of them. Don't be disheartened. The same subject as well as the same question will be easily understood later and you'll do fine. In Engineering, most of the time, we get to know the subject after the semester has passed, and also future courses help in making some of these earlier courses rock solid.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>7. Buy an online test series the year you are giving your GATE exam. I CANNOT press on how important it is. It will tell you how much negative you are doing, help keep a tab on your scores and improvements, and above all get you in the exam vibe.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Final notes -<br><br><strong>You'll be able to do it</strong>. Be honest in WHATEVER you study throughout your graduation programe. And, DO NOT DOUBT YOURSELF.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>All the best!</em></p>
